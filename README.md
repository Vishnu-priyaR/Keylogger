# Keylogger

A keylogger is a software tool that discreetly captures and records the keystrokes made by a user on a computer, often without their knowledge. In the context of a Python-based project, this keylogger serves as a monitoring tool with applications in security and data recovery. By secretly logging user keystrokes, it enables the collection of valuable information and, through secure email transmission, offers a means of monitoring computer activities, enhancing security measures, and aiding in data recovery efforts.
